A struct is a sequence of named elements, called fields, each of which has a name and a type. Field names may be specified explicitly (IdentifierList) or implicitly (EmbeddedField). Within a struct, non-blank field names must be unique.

We can take one struct and embed it in another struct. When you do this the inner type gets promoted to the outer type.

    It is good to become familiar with the language used to talk about this language. The “golang spec” can be difficult to read. I like spending some time with my students reading the language specification together so that they gain the skill of being able to read it on their own.
