Arrays are mostly used as a building block in the Go programming language. In some instances, we might use an array, but mostly the recommendation is to use slices instead.

*Array's in Golang have to have a specified amount, they can't change after specified

*Array's values must all be of the same type

An array of integers that can hold 5
  Ex: var x [5]int 

Getting the length of an array len(x)

Use Slices!
