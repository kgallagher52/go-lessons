Slices are built on top of arrays. A slice is dynamic in that it will grow in size. The underlying array, however, does not grow in size. When we create a slice, we can use the built in function make to specify how large our slice should be and also how large the underlying array should be. This can enhance performance a little bit.

  make([]T, length, capacity) 
  make([]int, 50, 100) 


* make - built in function

slices are built on top of an array

*	x := make(type, length, capacity)
  x := make([]int, 10, 1000)

  * cap(x) - gives capacity
