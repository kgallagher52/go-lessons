To append values to a slice, we use the special built in function append. This function returns a slice of the same type. 

* append gives you back another slice of the same TYPE

* ...T - this is a variadic paramater meaning you can add as many as you want


____________Deleting from a slice_______________
	x = append(x[:2], x[4:]...) // Deleting up to index 2 till index 4 but not including 4 results: [1,2,5,6,7,8,9]
