There is no while loops in Golang

Basic structure of a loop
	for init; condition; post {
	}

A "for" statement specifies repeated execution of a block. There are three forms: The iteration may be controlled by a single condition, a "for" clause, or a "range" clause.

For loop in it's simplest terms
	for a < b {
		a*=2
	

ForStmt = "for" [ Condition | ForClause | RangeClause ] Block .

Continue = If a condition is true don't move to the next code block rather jump back up and keep going through the loop
