HOW COMPUTERS WORK

    - computers run on electricity

    - electricity has two discrete states: ON and OFF

    - we can create coding schemes for “on” or “off” states
        1. EX: Haloween if light is off don't come to the house if it's on come trick-or-treat
            2^n
            1 porch light  = 2   messages 
            2 porch lights = 4   messages
            3 porch lights = 8   messages
            4 porch lights = 16  messages 
            5 porch lights = 32  messages
            6 porch lights = 64  messages
            7 porch lights = 128 messages
            8 porch lights = 256 messages

    - Binary
    
        *byte which is an alias for uint8
        *rune whis is an alias for int 32

        1 = on
        2 = off

        Binary Digits - how we get term bits

        Coding Scheme

            - ascii
            - UTF-8
    - Bits

        1 = bit
        8 bits = byte
        1000 bytes = kb  
        1000 kb = mb
        1000 mb = gb
        1000 gb = tb

    - First computer ENIAC
