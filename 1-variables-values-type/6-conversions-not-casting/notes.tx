Conversions - taking a value of a certain type and we convert it to another type


1. var a int

2. type customInt int

3. var b customInt

4. a = integer - b = customInt

5. a = b - Can't do this because you can't make a type equal another type

6. a = int(b) - This is now an integer because I converted it

"a = int(b)" - is called casting in other languages that is not the case with Golang it is converting
