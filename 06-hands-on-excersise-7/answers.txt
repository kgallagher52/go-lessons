Go emphasizes ease of programming. If you use the short declaration operator, you do not need to specify the type. *

In your own words, explain how computers work.
	Computers run on electricity. Electricity has two discrete states: on & off. We 	can associate a coding scheme with the state of a circuit. For example, the porch 	light on Halloween in America: when it is "on" it means "come trick or treat", and 	when it is "off" it means "go away." If we had two porch lights, we could encode 	four messages:

In relation to computers, what do zeros & ones represent?

A boolean value is one that is either true or false *
	true

If you have 5 porch lights, how many messages can you encode? *
	32

The computer power symbol is cleverly a ZERO and a ONE. This is pretty neat as ZERO represents OFF and ONE represents ON, which is exactly what a power symbol allows you to do - turn something ON and OFF. *
	true

"Bit" is an abbreviation of "binary digit" *
	true

ON & OFF, 1 & 0, Binary Digits, Bits, and Machine Language are all words used to refer to this idea that, within a computer, it's all nothing but a bunch of ZERO's and ONE's, or switches that are ON or OFF, it's all just a bunch of Binary Digits, or Bits, that's the language which computers speak, it's machine language. *
	true

circuits, switches, transistors, and even "gates" are all words used to refer to this thing within a computer that can either be ON or OFF. It's a circuit, it's a switch, it's a gate that can either be OPENED or CLOSED, it's a transistor - you will learn that people use all of those words to talk about this same thing, this ability of computers to store ON / OFF states. *
	true

The world's most popular text coding scheme today is *
	UTF-8

1000 bytes = *
	1 KB

1000 GB = *
	1 TB

How many circuits (aka transistors, switches, "lightbulbs" in my porch analogy) did the Eniac computer have? *
	16,000

rune is an alias for int32 *
	true

byte is an alias for uint8 *
	true

If you use type int, then the compiler will choose whether int32 or int64 is used. Another way to say this is that int has implementation-specific sizes. *
	true

As a rule of thumb, for numeric types, you should just use "int" for whole numbers (without decimals) and "float64" for real numbers (with decimals) *
	true

A string is a sequence of bytes. *
	true

Go source code is always UTF-8. *
	true

A string is a sequence of bytes that represent Unicode code points, called runes. *
	true

What is a coding scheme?
	Coding schema is certain bytes together creating a code

What is the number 42 in decimal? *
	2A

What is the number 42 in binary? *
	101010

What is the number 42 in hex? *
	2A
