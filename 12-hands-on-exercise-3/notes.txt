1. Create a new type: vehicle. 
    a. The underlying type is a struct. 
    b. The fields: 
        1. doors
        2. color

2. Create two new types: truck & sedan. 
    a. The underlying type of each of these new types is a struct. 
    b. Embed the “vehicle” type in both truck & sedan. 
    c. Give truck the field “fourWheel” which will be set to bool. 
    d. Give sedan the field “luxury” which will be set to bool. solution 

3. Using the vehicle, truck, and sedan structs: 
    a. using a composite literal, create a value of type truck and assign values to the fields; 
    b. using a composite literal, create a value of type sedan and assign values to the fields. 

4. Print out each of these values. 

5. Print out a single field from each of these values.
